Looping Statements:
    All Programming Language : Two Types
        Entry Check
            It check the condition, If the condition is satisfied then only it execute the Statements
                for
                while
        Exit Check
            It executes the Statements, and then it check the condition.
                do-while
    Python :
        Entry Check

Stages:
    Follows four stages.
        1. Initialization
        2. condition
        3. Statements
        4. Incerement Or Decrement.

For Loop:
    A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence ( List, a tuple, a set and a dictionary ).
    Keyword : for

Synatx:
    for variable_name in range() or (list, tuple...etc):
        Statements

range() :
    To loop through a set of code to specified number of times, we can use range() function
    Return a sequence of number , starting from 0 by default  and increments by 1 by default

    Syntax:
        range(start_value,range_value,step_value)


    Write a program to find the sum of first 5 natural numbers:
        1,2,3,4,5 = 15


while Loop:
    Syntax:
        while condition:
            Statements

        If you failed to increment your value then you while loop become an infinite loop

infinite Loop :
    You while loop with an end point  

Sentinal Loop:
    Sentinal Loop is an infinite loop it executes the statement until it reaches a special character or an end point

String Variable:    
    Index : To position the value of the string.
        Index always strats from 0 ...
    restart = "Yes"
        [0 , 1 , 2]
        [y, e, s]
        print(restart[0])
